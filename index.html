                <p>I was born and raised in Poughkeepsie, NY then moved to NYC for college. I studied abroad in Spain, 
                then transferred to American University in Washington, D.C. I studied once more in Irbid, Jordan for a summer semester 
                before graduating with a degree in International Relations. </p>

                <p>While studying abroad in Spain, I learned Spanish and was fortunate enough to visit Morocco, Italy, France and other parts of Spain. 
                Once I finished my summer semester in Jordan, I was able to spend a couple of weeks traveling around Israel and then about a month in Europe.</p>

                <p>After college, I decided to move to Europe where I got certified to teach English as a foreign language in Prauge. I then worked in Croatia
                for a summer at an international camp before moving to Berlin for a year where I taught English to children at a private bilingual pre-school and 
                to adults at a continuing education language school. </p>
